### A Personal Token Terms of Service

**Author:** [Reuben Bramanathan](http://bramanathan.com "Reuben Bramanathan")

You can hire and access Reuben's consulting services by [purchasing his $CNSL token](https://uniswap.exchange/swap?outputCurrency=0xea0bea4d852687c45fdc57f6b06a8a92302baabc "purchasing his token $CNSL").

**This is a template Terms of Service for your personal token.**

This template is: 
* designed to be used with an [ERC20 token](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/tokens) issued on the [Ethereum blockchain](https://ethereum.org/) with a capped supply
* for use by anyone who wants to tokenize their time - e.g., one token is redeemable for one hour of your time.
* based on a send-to-redeem model, not a burn-to-redeem model. It enables you to put redeemed tokens back into circulation
